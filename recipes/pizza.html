    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes Iâ€™ve tried over the years, this is the perfect pizza.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil. </li>
        <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>

    </ol>
